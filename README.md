# Features
- Cable cars move up and down the Pala Springs Aerial Tramway lines 
- Syncing between players during landing at lower platform
- Cars can be ridden by entering them and pressing E while they are landed
- Audio for tram movements, doors opening/closing, and the arrival/departure cues

# Disclaimer
This script tries to sync the cars, but it is not guaranteed that they are synced at all times
